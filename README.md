# COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths

This R shiny app displays visual representations of COVID-19 incident cases, cumulative cases, and deaths within Canada and across several countries. Users may specify a date range and view data on one region at a time, or compare multiple simultaneously regions in the same plot. The log transformation and standardization per 100,000 population options can be used to make comparisons across regions easier to interpret.

The files available in this repository can be used to either run the shiny app offline, or to host your own app. This app is hosted at https://ermacora.shinyapps.io/covid-19/
